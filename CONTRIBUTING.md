# Contribute your resources

If you are leading one of the hackathon tracks, know of some missing resources, or simply find an error in the listed resources, you can make changes to the repository as follows:

## 1. Clone the repository

Clone the repository on your development machine. For simple resource changes it is best to use the `main` branch, as it represents the current stable & launched version.
Now checkout to a new branch, e.g. `feature/new-resources`.

## 2. Make your changes

You can easily add, remove or adjust resources by editing the `content/resources.json` file.
